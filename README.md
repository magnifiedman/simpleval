# Simple Val Form Validation

I simple jQuery include for validating your forms before submit.

## Getting Started

Just link to the simpleval.js file from your page with your form. Creating required fields is a breeze...

### Installing and Using

```
Include the simpleval.js file at the end of your <body> tag after you include your desired jQuery library file
<script src="PATH_TO_FOLDER/simpleval.js"</script>
```
In your HTML form code, simply add the class="required" to any field that you wish to require. Validation will be done on all fields simultaneously.
```
Form is tied to jQuery .submit(), so if you wish to tie any ajax to submission, use that hook.
```
